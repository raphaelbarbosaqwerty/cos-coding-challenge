Welcome to the CarOnSale Flutter Coding Challenge.

To assess your skills and knowledge about Flutter and Dart, we want you to build a mobile application for Android and iOS.

## Your Task:
Please fork the repo and create the Flutter project in the directory of this README.

Build a Flutter mobile application for Android and iOS that includes:
- A **login page**
  - Uses Firebase Authentication (email + password) ✔️
  - Registration of new users is not needed ✔️
  - Just add a dummy user and password in Firebase ✔️
- A **profile page** containing:
  - User's email ✔️
  - User's profile picture
  - User's preferred photo method
    - Can be switched between Camera and Gallery
    - Should be stored, so that the settings stay the same after application is closed and reopened
  - An option to change the user's password 
  - An option to change the user's profile picture (please check the user's preferred photo method)
  - An option to logout ✔️

- A **vehicle inspection overview page** containing:
  - List of previously done inspections ✔️
    - List is sorted by creation time in descending order ✔️
    - If a list item is clicked, a prefilled *vehicle inspection details page* will be opened ✔️
  - Floating Action Button to create a new inspection ✔️
    - If clicked an empty *vehicle inspection details page* is opened ✔️

- A **vehicle inspection details page** containing:
  - This page should be implemented as a form with validation:
    - Date of inspection (required) - Date cannot be in the future
    - Vehicle Identification Number (required) - must be exactly 17 characters. Cannot contain I, O, U characters. Can only contain numbers and letters.
    - Vehicle make (optional) ❎
    - Vehicle model (optional) ❎
    - Vehicle photo (optional) ❎
  - If the required form fields do not match the validation criteria the page cannot be closed and the user should get a warning message
